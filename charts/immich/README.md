### Immich

Immich is a high performance self-hosted photo and video management solution. It is a full replacement for services like iCloud and Google Photos. With Immich you can backup your favorite memories, create albums, and share them all while maintaining your privacy.

#### How to Use

After installing Immich (it'll take a few minutes), go here to set up the app: http://photos.local

Once you're done with that you can now install the mobile app and login to your new account.

**NOTE**: When logging into your mobile app for the first time it will ask you for a "Server Endpoint URL". This will be:

```
http://photos.local/api
```
