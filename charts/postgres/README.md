### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

PostgreSQL is automatically installed into Home Cloud when it is required by another app. The PostgreSQL Home Cloud app has [pgvecto.rs](pgvecto.rs) installed to support applications like [Immich](https://immich.app/).

#### How to Use

There's nothing you need to do for PostgreSQL to work. It simply runs in the background and makes all your other apps work correctly.
